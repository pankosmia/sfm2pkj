\s1 God's guidance in your life
\s2 God's voice or your gps
\p You are growing up in a metropolis. Daily you walk through streets where the underworld rules. Anything God has forbidden happens. Indeed a godless city. Nobody has heard about God. Let alone about the words of judgment and mercy with which He reaches out to people. You do not know that far away a man is called: \qt Arise\qt*, Jonah!

\p

\v 2 “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me.”

\ms Away from the presence of God
\mr (1:3)
\p Jona thinks that he can outwit God. He does not set out for Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. He turns exactly the other direction: towards Tarshish in Spain. He runs away \qt from the presence of God\qt*. You may think that God does not notice it and that you yourself are in charge. In the meantime, it only results in misery and trouble.
\esbe
\p
\v 3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*.
