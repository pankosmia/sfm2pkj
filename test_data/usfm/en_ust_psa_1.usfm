\q1 who do not imitate the behavior of sinful people,

\v 2 Instead, those with whom Yahweh is pleased delight in understanding what he teaches us.
\q2 They read and think every day and every night about what Yahweh teaches.

\v 3 They constantly do things that please God,
\q2 just as fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year.

\s5
